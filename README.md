# 🧠 Stroke Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on building and deploying a **Stroke Prediction System** using **Logistic Regression**. It leverages a medical dataset to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on key health indicators. The model is integrated into a web application built with **Flask** and styled using **Bootstrap**, offering an intuitive and interactive user experience.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict the risk of stroke in individuals using a Logistic Regression model.
- Provide an easy-to-use web interface for real-time predictions.
- Improve prediction accuracy and user interaction.

---

## 🚀 Highlights

✅ Developed and trained a Logistic Regression model on stroke-related health data  
✅ Achieved a **16% improvement in accuracy** through data preprocessing and feature engineering  
✅ Built an interactive UI using **Bootstrap**  
✅ Deployed the model with **Flask** for real-time stroke risk predictions
